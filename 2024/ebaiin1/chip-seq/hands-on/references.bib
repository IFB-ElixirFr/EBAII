Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression.

	abstract = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.
Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows–Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ∼10–20× faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.

Here, we used repetitive elements, including retrotransposons, as model loci to address how and when heterochromatin forms during development. RNA sequencing throughout early mouse embryogenesis revealed that repetitive-element expression is dynamic and stage specific, with most repetitive elements becoming repressed before implantation. We show that LINE-1 and IAP retrotransposons become reactivated from both parental genomes after fertilization. Chromatin immunoprecipitation for H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 in 2- and 8-cell embryos indicates that their developmental silencing follows loss of activating marks rather than acquisition of conventional heterochromatic marks. Furthermore, short LINE-1 RNAs regulate LINE-1 transcription in vivo. Our data indicate that reprogramming after mammalian fertilization comprises a robust transcriptional activation of retrotransposons and that repetitive elements are initially regulated through RNA.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Testing for correlations between different sets of genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research. However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner. Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.

These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and {H3K4me1} patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Chromatin states are the key to gene regulation and cell identity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation ({ChIP)} coupled with high-throughput sequencing ({ChIP-Seq)} is increasingly being used to map epigenetic states across genomes of diverse species. Chromatin modification profiles are frequently noisy and diffuse, spanning regions ranging from several nucleosomes to large domains of multiple genes. Much of the early work on the identification of {ChIP-enriched} regions for {ChIP-Seq} data has focused on identifying localized regions, such as transcription factor binding sites. Bioinformatic tools to identify diffuse domains of {ChIP-enriched} regions have been lacking.
Results: Based on the biological observation that histone modifications tend to cluster to form domains, we present a method that identifies spatial clusters of signals unlikely to appear by chance. This method pools together enrichment information from neighboring nucleosomes to increase sensitivity and specificity. By using genomic-scale analysis, as well as the examination of loci with validated epigenetic states, we demonstrate that this method outperforms existing methods in the identification of {ChIP-enriched} signals for histone modification profiles. We demonstrate the application of this unbiased method in important issues in {ChIP-Seq} data analysis, such as data normalization for quantitative comparison of levels of epigenetic modifications across cell types and growth conditions.

	Abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at                   http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html                                  .},

@article{mFuzz,
	Abstract = {  For the analysis of microarray data, clustering techniques are frequently used. Most of such methods are based on hard clustering of data wherein one gene (or sample) is assigned to exactly one cluster. Hard clustering, however, suffers from several drawbacks such as sensitivity to noise and information loss.  In contrast, soft clustering methods can assign a gene to several clusters. They can overcome shortcomings of conventional hard clustering techniques and offer further advantages. Thus, we constructed an R package termed Mfuzz implementing soft clustering tools for microarray data analysis. The additional package Mfuzzgui provides a convenient TclTk based graphical user interface. AVAILABILITY:  The R package Mfuzz and Mfuzzgui are available at http://itb1.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~futschik/software/R/Mfuzz/index.html. Their distribution is subject to GPL version 2 license.},

	abstract = {Summary: A motif is a short {DNA} or protein sequence that contributes to the biological function of the sequence in which it resides. Over the past several decades, many computational methods have been described for identifying, characterizing and searching with sequence motifs. Critical to nearly any motif-based sequence analysis pipeline is the ability to scan a sequence database for occurrences of a given motif described by a position-specific frequency matrix.
Results: We describe Find Individual Motif Occurrences ({FIMO)}, a software tool for scanning {DNA} or protein sequences with motifs described as position-specific scoring matrices. The program computes a log-likelihood ratio score for each position in a given sequence database, uses established dynamic programming methods to convert this score to a P-value and then applies false discovery rate analysis to estimate a q-value for each position in the given sequence. {FIMO} provides output in a variety of formats, including {HTML}, {XML} and several Santa Cruz Genome Browser formats. The program is efficient, allowing for the scanning of {DNA} sequences at a rate of 3.5 Mb/s on a single {CPU.}
Availability and Implementation: {FIMO} is part of the {MEME} Suite software toolkit. A web server and source code are available at http://meme.sdsc.edu.

While there are many existing tools for discovering TF binding site motifs in such datasets, most web-based tools cannot directly process such large datasets., Results: The MEME-ChIP web service is designed to analyze ChIP-seq ‘peak regions’—short genomic regions surrounding declared ChIP-seq ‘peaks’. Given a set of genomic regions, it performs (i) ab initio motif discovery, (ii) motif enrichment analysis, (iii) motif visualization, (iv) binding affinity analysis and (v) motif identification. It runs two complementary motif discovery algorithms on the input data—MEME and DREME—and uses the motifs they discover in subsequent visualization, binding affinity and identification steps. MEME-ChIP also performs motif enrichment analysis using the AME algorithm, which can detect very low levels of enrichment of binding sites for TFs with known DNA-binding motifs. Importantly, unlike with the MEME web service, there is no restriction on the size or number of uploaded sequences, allowing very large ChIP-seq datasets to be analyzed. The analyses performed by MEME-ChIP provide the user with a varied view of the binding and regulatory activity of the ChIP-ed TF, as well as the possible involvement of other DNA-binding TFs., Availability: MEME-ChIP is available as part of the MEME Suite at http://meme.nbcr.net., Contact: t.bailey@uq.edu.au, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases., Results: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80–90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy., Availability and implementation: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

	abstract = {Summary: The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a generic alignment format for storing read alignments against reference sequences, supporting short and long reads (up to 128 Mbp) produced by different sequencing platforms. It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are released. SAMtools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments., Availability: http://samtools.sourceforge.net, Contact: rd@sanger.ac.uk},
