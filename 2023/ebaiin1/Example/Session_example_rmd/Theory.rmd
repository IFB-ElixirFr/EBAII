Including RMarkdown to Jupyter-notebook is easy: simply compile your [R-markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or [Restructured Text](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/reStructuredText/) before compiling the whole book.

Image inclusion is automatic from R code:

```{r}
plot(cars)
```
